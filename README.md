- 👋 Hi, I’m @bam607
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to program and create web, desktop, and mobile applications.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, java, js, html, css, and sql
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on an application that I plan to build for the landscaping company I work for, where we can create a databse of our customers, jobs, schedule workorders, and perform data analysis to improve our work efficiency.
